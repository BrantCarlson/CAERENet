Noise tests
===========

Some initial things to try to measure/diagnose/reduce noise...
- box open vs closed
- electrodes exposed vs covered with grounded sheet
- power supply with load 30ohm load resistor or not
- near laptop or not

Files in testdat subdir:
- C (box closed), c (box open)
- E (electrodes exposed), e (electrodes partially covered with grounded plate)
- R (load resistor in place), r (no load resistor)
- L (laptop nearby), l (laptop not nearby)



box closed, electrodes exposed, load resistor in place, near laptop --> CERL
